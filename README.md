# FoundryVTT Mageflame SRD

A (mostly correct) scraped import of SRD monsters from https://www.13thagesrd.com/monsters/ for https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/archmage/tree/master provided under the Open Game License


## Here be data problems!

Nearly 400 monsters is too many for me to review by hand, although I've done the best I can. Please report any data issues as a Github Issue. Thanks!
